At Security Tapestry, we are committed to providing you with the latest information on cybersecurity threats. We would like to inform you about a recent development concerning the 3CX Desktop App.

On March 30, 2023, our researchers uncovered information detailing a malicious threat campaign using a backdoored version of the 3CX Desktop App installer. This campaign leverages a compromised installer to deliver malware to victims' systems, resulting in unauthorized access and potential data exfiltration.

The Security Tapestry research team has identified the following key details:

*	The compromised installer is distributed through official links, this is nothing a user did.
*	This affects both Mac and Windows Platforms
*	It shares similarities with other malicious campaigns targeting VoIP applications.
*	The malware uses C2 communication to exfiltrate data and receive further commands.
*	Affected users may notice increased network traffic and unexpected system behavior.

We advise all customers to exercise caution while downloading and installing the 3CX Desktop App. To mitigate risks, please ensure that you:

*	Uninstall any versions of the 3CX Desktop App and use the PWA (Progressive Web App) available on the official website.
*	Regularly update your security software and system patches.
*	Retroactively look for traces remaining of the Desktop App


Our team is constantly monitoring this situation, and we will provide updates as necessary. If you suspect that your systems have been affected or require further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Stay safe and secure,

The Security Tapestry Team
