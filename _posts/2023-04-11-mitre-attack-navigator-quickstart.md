## Introduction
The MITRE ATT&CK Navigator v3 is a web-based tool that provides an interactive way to explore the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The tool allows you to visualize the tactics and techniques associated with different threat actors and use cases. In this tutorial, we will walk through the steps for using the MITRE ATT&CK Navigator v3.

## Familiarize yourself with the interface
The MITRE ATT&CK Navigator v3 interface consists of four main sections: the menu bar, the view pane, the details pane, and the filter pane.

The menu bar is located at the top of the page and provides access to different features of the tool, such as the ability to add layers or import/export configurations.

The view pane is the main section of the tool and displays the tactics and techniques associated with different threat actors or use cases. You can click on any of the tactics or techniques to view more details about them in the details pane.

The details pane is located on the right side of the page and provides additional information about the selected tactic or technique. This includes a description, examples, and references.

The filter pane is located on the left side of the page and allows you to filter the tactics and techniques based on various criteria, such as tactic or technique name, actor or tool used, and data source.

## Explore the framework
To explore the MITRE ATT&CK framework using the Navigator, you can start by selecting a threat actor or use case from the drop-down menu in the view pane. This will display the tactics and techniques associated with that particular threat actor or use case.

You can then click on any of the tactics or techniques to view more details about them in the details pane. The details pane provides additional information about the selected tactic or technique, such as a description, examples, and references.

You can also use the filter pane to narrow down the tactics and techniques based on various criteria. For example, you can filter by tactic or technique name, actor or tool used, or data source.

## Add layers
One of the useful features of the MITRE ATT&CK Navigator v3 is the ability to add layers. Layers allow you to add custom data to the tool, such as observations from your own environment or notes from an investigation.

To add a layer, click on the "Layers" button in the menu bar and then click on the "Add Layer" button. You can then enter a name for the layer and select the color you want to use for the layer.

Once you have added a layer, you can click on the tactics or techniques in the view pane to add them to the layer. You can also add notes or observations to the layer by clicking on the "Edit Layer" button and then selecting the appropriate tactic or technique.

## Export and share
Once you have explored the MITRE ATT&CK framework and added any custom data using layers, you can export your configuration to a file. This allows you to save your work or share it with others.

To export your configuration, click on the "File" button in the menu bar and then select "Export Configuration". You can then save the file to your computer or share it with others.

In conclusion, the MITRE ATT&CK Navigator v3 is a powerful tool for exploring the MITRE ATT&CK framework. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you should be able to navigate and use the tool effectively. Remember to familiarize yourself with the interface, explore the framework, add layers, and export and share your work as needed. By doing so, you can gain a deeper understanding of the tactics and techniques used by different threat actors and use that knowledge to improve your cybersecurity defenses.
